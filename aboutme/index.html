    <p>Hello every one, I'm 28 years and I live in mexico. Currently I'm married with a wonderful woman and we have 
        baby that is 18 mothns old, his name is Yeshua Helaman. </p>
    <p>I actualy work as Tech support for TCL company for cell phones. I assist customers across the US and Canda. I really like my job!</p>
    <p>This is my first semester for web development carrier. For the past semesters I was studing 
        through Ensign Collage the IT carrier but I realized that I liked more programing cause in last semester of Pathway I took one class called: intro to programing, with Java script. 
        Being on IT for a couple semesters made me to become more proficient into that area, but I also learned that IT doesn't make me such happy as 
        programing. </p>
